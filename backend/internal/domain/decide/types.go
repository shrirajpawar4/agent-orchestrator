// LifecycleDecision is the output of every decider: the derived display status
// plus the canonical sub-state values to persist, the human-readable evidence,
// and the (possibly updated) detecting memory.
//
// Zero-value sub-state fields mean "this decider does not address that
// sub-state — leave it unchanged", NOT "set it to the empty value". SessionState
// is always populated, but the probe/detecting/kill paths legitimately leave
// PRState/PRReason empty: a liveness verdict knows nothing about the PR. When
// the LCM turns a decision into a LifecyclePatch it must therefore map an empty
// PRState to a nil patch.PR (left untouched) rather than writing it through —
// writing PRNone on a routine probe tick would clobber a live PR. Detecting is
// nil-by-default for the same reason; see LifecyclePatch's three-way
// Detecting/ClearDetecting semantics.
